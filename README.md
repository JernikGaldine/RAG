Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using OpenAI's API for generation and LangChain for managing text processing and retrieval.

Features
OpenAI API: Utilizes OpenAI's powerful language models for text generation.
LangChain: Manages text splitting, embeddings, and retrieval operations.
RAG Approach: Combines retrieval of relevant information with generation of responses for enhanced chatbot capabilities.

Requirements
Python 3.7+
Installation of required libraries:
pip install openai langchain

Setup

1. Get OpenAI API Key
Sign up for OpenAI API access at OpenAI API.
Obtain your API key from the OpenAI dashboard.

2. Set Environment Variables
Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
export OPENAI_API_KEY='openai_api_key'.

3.Extract the information form the url.

4.perform the retrival using open ai.

Example Interaction
Enter a query or question.
The chatbot will retrieve relevant information using LangChain's retrieval capabilities.
OpenAI will generate a response based on the retrieved information and the query.

This README.md template should give users a clear understanding of how to set up and run your RAG chatbot project using OpenAI's API and LangChain
